# Data Mining University Project

This repository contains a Data Mining university project implemented using Python. The project focuses on applying data mining techniques to extract meaningful information and patterns from datasets through data preprocessing, transformation, modeling, and evaluation.

The project demonstrates the practical use of supervised data mining methods, including Linear Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), following a complete data mining workflow.

--------------------------------------------------

PROJECT OBJECTIVES

The main objectives of this project are:
- Apply data mining concepts on real datasets
- Clean and preprocess raw data
- Handle missing and inconsistent data
- Transform and encode categorical attributes
- Build predictive and classification models
- Evaluate model performance using standard metrics
- Allow user input for prediction and classification

DATASET DESCRIPTION

- The datasets include both numerical and categorical attributes
- Some attributes contain missing values that require preprocessing
- Data transformation was applied before modeling
- The data was divided into training and testing sets to ensure fair evaluation

--------------------------------------------------

DATA PREPROCESSING AND TRANSFORMATION

The following data mining preprocessing techniques were applied:
- Handling missing values using mean, median, or mode
- Encoding categorical variables using Label Encoding, One-Hot Encoding, and Ordinal Encoding
- Feature selection and transformation
- Splitting data into training and testing sets

--------------------------------------------------

LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL

Purpose:
Linear Regression was used as a predictive data mining technique to estimate continuous target values based on multiple input features.

Process:
- Data preparation and feature selection
- Training the Linear Regression model
- Making predictions on unseen data
- Accepting user input to generate predictions

Evaluation Metrics:
- R² Score
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

--------------------------------------------------

K-NEAREST NEIGHBORS (KNN) CLASSIFICATION

Purpose:
KNN was used as a classification data mining technique to assign class labels based on the nearest neighboring data points.

Process:
- Feature preprocessing and encoding
- Training the KNN classifier
- Testing model performance on unseen data
- Allowing user input for classification prediction

Evaluation:
- Accuracy score
- Comparison of different K values
